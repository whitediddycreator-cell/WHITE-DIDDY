Hi White Diddy is being updated Monday-Friday. I am using VB code to code this shitty rpg game, I do use ai to help (not taking full credit) but I do bring code and ALL the ideas, thanks. :) 

This is a .VBS so the code is open source.

To download locate White Diddy Folder and download raw. That means to click the CODE next to Issues, locate the folder, and please click the White Diddy folder and download it. (THIS DOES NOT NEED ADMINISTRATOR)
